# VR-XR-GameRoom

## Description

GameRoom is a VR simulation created using Unity. Players are placed in front of a table in a virtual game room where they can interact with buttons to manage the battlefield. It's a sandbox experience that gives you the freedom to explore and interact with the virtual environment however you like.

## Key Features

- **Immersive VR Environment**: Step into a fully interactive virtual game room
- **Strategic Battle System**: Control dynamic battles where shapes compete for table dominance
- **Natural Physics Interactions**: Pick up, throw, and manipulate shapes with realistic physics
- **Team Tactics**: Watch as shapes coordinate with allies, combining their strength to overcome opponents
- **Dynamic Color Fusion**: Experience unique visual effects as shapes merge and combine colors during battle

## Game Controls

Use VR controllers to naturally interact with the virtual space. Grab and throw shapes with your hands, press buttons to control the action, and shape the battlefield exactly how you want it.

### Button Controls

- **Cube Spawner Button**: Spawn cubes on the left side of the table
- **Sphere Spawner Button**: Spawn spheres on the right side of the table
- **Play/Pause Button**: Controls the battle sequence
- **Clear Button**: Removes all shapes from the table

## About the Project

This project demonstrates VR development capabilities using Unity. It started as an experimental project with an old VR headset, aimed at learning VR development fundamentals. The ultimate goal was to build a foundation for future augmented reality development once I acquire more advanced technology.
