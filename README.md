# VR-XR-GameRoom

## Description

VR-XR-GameRoom is a VR game I created using Unity. You are placed in front of a table in a virtual game room where you can interact with buttons to engage various shapes. It's a sandbox experience, giving you the freedom to explore and interact with the virtual environment however you like.

## Key Features
- A fully immersive VR experience
- Shapes battle to push each other off the table
- You can pick up and manipulate shapes freely

### Buttons
- **Cube Spawner**: Spawns cubes on the left side of the table
- **Sphere Spawner**: Spawns spheres on the right side of the table
- **Play/Pause**: Starts and stops the shape battle
- **Clear Shapes**: Removes all spawned shapes from the table

## Game Controls
You can use your hands to interact with objects as you please.

## About the Project

This project showcases my skills in VR development. I had an old VR headset lying around and wanted to experiment with developing a VR game. My goal was to learn the fundamentals of VR development so that when I get my hands on a device like the Meta Quest 3, I can explore augmented reality development as well.

## How to Play
- A VR headset is required to play
